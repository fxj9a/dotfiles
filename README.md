# My dotfiles
Hi.

This is my dotfiles backup archive.

Each hostname has its own branch.

The master branch is the (empty) blueprint for future branches.

## TODO

- Add more dotfiles because "Impossible. Perhaps the archives are incomplete"

## unhelpful git commit messages
```shell
git config --global alias.yolo '!git commit -am "_ `curl -s https://whatthecommit.com/index.txt`"'
```

## Branches (active)
- mimax
- serenity
- kogata
